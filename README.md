# Glassdoor_Analysis
I go over some interesting facts in the Glassdoor Dataset.

I followed the [Data Science Hive](https://www.datasciencehive.com/data-analyst-path) website's [Homework 2.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWrl4_E5qdsv9dsHOAu5jbgGQ6zjMB2JFZN-yoRUIoo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dhat3tnlvtlz) questions involving the [Glassdoor Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor?select=Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv).

For the same reason as with my previous project, I've decided to use Power Query instead of basic Excel functions.<br/>
Excel functions are easier to use but I wanted to practice using Power Query since it can handle a greater dataset.
